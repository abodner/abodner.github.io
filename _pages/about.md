Hello! I am an Assistant Professor in the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where I hold a shared position between the Departments of [Earth, Atmospheric, and Planetary Sciences (EAPS)](https://eapsweb.mit.edu/), and [Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS)](https://www.eecs.mit.edu/). My research interests span climate, physical oceanography, geophysical fluid dynamics, and turbulence. I investigate turbulence in the upper ocean from O(100 km) to O(1 m) using a combination of theory, high-resolution numerical simulations, climate models, and machine learning. I also have a growing interest in coastal sea level drivers. 

Previous to MIT, I was a [Simons Society Junior Fellow](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/simons-society-of-fellows/) working with [Dr. Laure Zanna](https://laurezanna.github.io/) at the [Courant Institute](https://caos.cims.nyu.edu/dynamic/) of Mathematical Sciences,  New York University. As an affiliate in the [Multiscale Machine Learning In Coupled Earth System Modeling (M²LInES)](https://m2lines.github.io/), I worked on a data-driven approach to improve the unresolved physics associated with $\mathcal{O}$(1 km) ocean submesoscale turbulence in climate models, which plays an important role in ocean-atmosphere interactions, yet is unresolved in climate models, even at the highest possible resolution.


In my PhD, under the guidance of [Prof. Baylor Fox-Kemper](http://www.geo.brown.edu/research/Fox-Kemper/) at [Brown University](https://www.brown.edu/academics/earth-environmental-planetary-sciences/), I developed a physics-based approach to evaluate and parameterize the long-sought-after dynamic interplay between ocean submesoscales and boundary layer turbulence. The significance of this work has recently been recognized by the [Community Earth Systems Model](https://www.cesm.ucar.edu/events/workshops/2022/) Graduate Student Award and is being implemented in next-generation climate models. 

I am fascinated by the way mathematics can describe fluid motion, and during my time at Brown I have also earned an ScM in Applied Mathematics. Before coming to Brown I received my MSc in Atmospheric Sciences from [Tel Aviv University](https://english.tau.ac.il/) where I studied the effects of stationary waves generated by topography on large scale atmospheric circulation. I also have a double major BSc in Mathematics and Earth Sciences from Tel Aviv University. 

I am passionate about teaching, and am especially motivated to teach computational tools for climate science. I believe it is critical that the future generation of scientists are properly trained to use the wealth of climate data and tools available on open-source platforms. I have co-founded [Climatematch Academy](https://academy.climatematch.io/), an online program with a mission to build a global and diverse climate science community, equipped with computational tools to tackle global challenges of our changing climate. 


I am married to [Bar Guzi](https://brandeis.academia.edu/BarGuzi) and mother to Micah, Amelia, and Imrie who inspire and challenge me to be the best version of myself every day.
