I recently joined [Dr. Laure Zanna ºs](https://laurezanna.github.io/) research group at [CAOS](https://caos.cims.nyu.edu/dynamic/) as a [Simons Society of Fellows - Junior Fellow](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/simons-society-of-fellows/). I am working on a novel machine learning approach which combines theory, model simulations and observational measurements to study how small-scale coastal flow dynamics contribute to our understanding of global sea level rise.

I recieved my PhD from the [Department of Earth, Environmental and Planetary Sciences at Brown University](https://www.brown.edu/academics/earth-environmental-planetary-sciences/) working with [Dr. Baylor Fox-Kemper](http://www.geo.brown.edu/research/Fox-Kemper/). My PhD was focused on improving the theory and model representation of ocean surface submesoscale flows, which play an important role in atmosphere-ocean interactions and simulating the climate system.

My general interests span a broad range of problems involving climate dynamics, geophysical fluid dynamics and turbulence. I primarily use theory and models to study the non-linear interaction between small scale processes and larger scale dynamics. I am fascinated by the way mathematics can describe fluid motion, and during my time at Brown I have also earned an ScM in Applied Mathematics. Before coming to Brown I received my MSc in Atmospheric Sciences from [Tel Aviv University](https://english.tau.ac.il/) where I studied the effects of stationary waves generated by topography on large scale atmospheric circulation. I also have a double major BSc in Mathematics and Earth Sciences from Tel Aviv University. 

I am married to [Bar Guzi](https://brandeis.academia.edu/BarGuzi) and mother to Micah and Amelia who inspire and challange me to be the best version of myself every day.
