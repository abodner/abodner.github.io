I am a PhD candidate in the Department of Earth, Environmental and Planetary Sciences at Brown University working with Dr. Baylor Fox-Kemper on upper ocean mixing, specifically on ocean fronts and how they interact with turbulence. I am fascinated by the way mathematics can describe fluid motion and during my time at Brown I have also earned an ScM in Applied Mathematics. My general interests span a broad range of problems involving climate dynamics, geophysical fluid dynamics and turbulence. I primarily use theory and models to study the non-linear interaction between small scale processes and larger scale dynamics. Before coming to Brown I earned my MSc in Atmospheric Sciences from Tel Aviv University (Israel) where I studied the effects of stationary waves generated by topography on large scale atmospheric circulation. I have a double major BSc in Mathematics and Earth Sciences from Tel Aviv University.
